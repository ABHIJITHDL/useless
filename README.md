### Project Description
I Troll U, a fun and interactive web-based puzzle game designed to challenge your wits and sense of humor. This project is a collection of various puzzles and games that will keep you entertained while testing your problem-solving skills.
I Troll U is a playful project that combines humor with puzzles. The goal is to solve a series of challenges that range from spotting differences to stopping a counter at a specific time. Each puzzle is designed to be tricky and fun, often with a humorous twist.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Problem of impatience in the society and testing your patience.
Impatience is a problem that is exponentially growing in the society.
Impatiance is useless, hence the project we build is useless.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We test your patience with:
Spot the Difference: Identify the correct bat among several options.
Counter Challenge: Stop the counter at exactly 42 seconds.
Funny Ambition Selection: Choose your branch, habit, ambition, and superpower in a humorous way.
Loading Screen: Experience a funny and interactive loading screen with random messages.
Video Playback: Watch a video and get redirected to the next challenge.
